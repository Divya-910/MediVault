00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.500
It’s important to remember:
our physical health affects

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.500
our mental health, and
vice versa.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.208
What we do to our bodies makes

00:00:07.208 --> 00:00:09.041
a big difference to how we feel.

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:12.541
Physical activity, diet,
alcohol, smoking and drugs can

00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:16.458
all affect our mental health
and wellbeing in different ways.

00:00:16.458 --> 00:00:17.958
So, let’s talk about them.

00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:21.333
Physical activity releases
feel-good  hormones

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:24.750
called endorphins,  which help
us sleep and feel better.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.750
It also improves our physical
fitness, which tends

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.875
to make people
feel better in general.

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:32.625
Even small amounts of
regular physical activity,

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:35.583
can improve your mental
wellbeing - especially if it’s

00:00:35.583 --> 00:00:38.625
doing something you enjoy.
Physical activity is even

00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:41.458
a recommended treatment for
some types of depression.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:42.708
You can get active

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:44.583
at your own pace,
in your own way.

00:00:44.583 --> 00:00:47.000
There’s no need to
join a gym or

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.625
even spend any money.
Simple, small changes

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:52.125
in our day-to-day
can make all the difference.

00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:54.416
Taking a brisk walk
at lunchtime or walking

00:00:54.416 --> 00:00:56.708
to get where we’re
going, getting active in

00:00:56.708 --> 00:00:58.958
the garden, or cycling
once or twice a week

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.375
are great options.

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:02.125
If there is a
type of activity you used

00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:04.333
to enjoy, think about
how you could pick

00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.541
it up again.
For example, there are lots

00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:09.166
of groups in local
areas open to all

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.416
levels of ability.

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.916
What’s more, studies show
that time in green spaces

00:01:13.916 --> 00:01:16.625
is beneficial, so head
to your local park

00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:17.583
if you can!

00:01:17.583 --> 00:01:19.750
If you need a
little help fitting more

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.833
physical activity into your
day, try the Active 10 app

00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:25.541
It helps you get
short bursts of brisk

00:01:25.541 --> 00:01:27.041
walking into your day.

00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:29.833
There’s also the fantastic
Couch to 5K app,

00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:32.958
which will get you
up and running in just 9 weeks!

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.666
Eating better can play
a big role in

00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:36.875
our health and wellbeing.

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:39.500
It won’t come as
a surprise to learn

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.375
that what we eat,
and how much, plays

00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:43.625
a big part in our
physical health – which

00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:45.625
can impact our
mental health too.

00:01:45.625 --> 00:01:47.458
Ideally, we should aim
to eat a healthy balanced diet,

00:01:47.458 --> 00:01:50.208
with plenty
of fruit and veg.

00:01:50.208 --> 00:01:52.000
It’s important to keep
an eye on your calories,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.583
and minimise foods
that are high in

00:01:54.583 --> 00:01:56.416
sugar, fat and salt.

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:59.500
For helpful tips on
eating a better diet, check

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.500
out the One You website.

00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:05.666
Alcohol, caffeine, tobacco,
and even drugs may seem

00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:07.750
tempting when we’re
stressed or tired.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.041
And, when we use
them to try and cope

00:02:10.041 --> 00:02:12.333
the idea of stopping
them can feel like

00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:13.916
it would make
things even harder.

00:02:13.916 --> 00:02:16.666
But they can cause
more problems than they

00:02:16.666 --> 00:02:18.333
solve, especially long-term.

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:21.250
All these habits can
complicate our sleep patterns,

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.958
and affect how anxious
and depressed we feel.

00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.458
So try cutting down
(or even quitting).

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:29.041
And remember that
there’s support available.

00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:32.416
Alcohol in particular can
worsen our moods, so

00:02:32.416 --> 00:02:34.750
cutting down can really
help us feel better.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.375

you can download the

00:02:37.375 --> 00:02:38.583

As for cigarettes,
stopping smoking is one of

00:02:47.291 --> 00:02:48.708
the best things you
can do for your

00:02:48.708 --> 00:02:51.416
body and your brain.

what’s good for your body
is good for your mind.
